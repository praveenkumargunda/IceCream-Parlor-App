This project is all about building a Ice cream parlor kind of application. In this we have a ice_cream_parlor.py file and a schema.sql file which contains the structure of the table and sample_data.sql that contains the whole data which comprises of seasonal flavors, customer suggestions and ingredients details. And ingredients contain binary values. 0 representing that it is not allergic and 1 representing that itt is allergic.
Command to run this applcation : "python ice_cream_parlor.py".
And to run this application we need all these files. so in the code we have given each part of code that is relevantthe below mentioned functions. And then a main method where the code part is of all the 9 functions that helps us to enter the oprions to run this application.
And the basic desgin of this app is very simple as we used the python code to build this and it will be giving us the result of nine different operaions and they are:
1.Seasonal Flavors
2. Search Flavors
3. Filter by Ingredient
4. Add Allergen
5. Display Cart
6. Add Flavor to Cart
7. View Ingredients
8. View Customer Suggestions
9. Exit. 
Let's see about each function:
After running thsi code, these nine options will be dispalyed and we will be asked to enter a option from 1 to 9. And by giving any of the number, certailn tasks will be performed.
=> By selecting 1,  we will be getting what are all the flavors present in our database.
=> By selecting 2, we will be able to searcch the flavor by just giving that particular fruit or dryfruit name. If we dont have the flavor with the given anme we will not get any result.
=> By selecting 3, we can filter the products by the ingredient it contains. And if we give a different ingredient other than the ones present in our database at thatbwe might not get the desired results.
=> By selecting 4, we can add the allergens to the list. Stating that this might cause allergy.
=> By selecting 5, we can view whhat are the ice creams present in our cart.
=> By selecting 6, we can be able to dd the ice creams by entering their ID numbers according to the order they present in the seasonal flavors.
=> By selecting 7, we can be able to view what are the ingredients present within us.
=> By selecting 8, we can get the details of the customer name,suggestions and the flavor they are allergic to.
=> By selcting 9, we will be exiting from our application.
